# Apple Quality Prediction Using Machine Learning 🍏🔍
This project focuses on predicting the quality of apples based on various features such as size, color, and firmness using Machine Learning techniques. The goal is to build a model that can accurately classify the quality of apples, helping producers and consumers assess quality before purchase.

🚀 Technologies Used
Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Machine Learning Algorithms: Decision Trees, Random Forest, SVM, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Data Preprocessing: Feature scaling, handling missing data, and encoding categorical features

🔍 Project Overview
In this project, I used various machine learning algorithms to predict the quality of apples based on features such as:

Size (weight, dimensions)

Color (RGB values or color classification)

Firmness (texture, ripeness)

Defects (blemishes, bruises)

Steps Involved:
Data Collection & Preprocessing: Clean the data, handle missing values, and scale features for optimal performance.

Model Training: I trained multiple models such as Random Forest and SVM to predict apple quality.

Model Evaluation: Used metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall to evaluate model performance.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Applied techniques like GridSearchCV to fine-tune model parameters for better predictions.

📊 Results
The best-performing model was the Random Forest algorithm, achieving an accuracy of [insert accuracy here], providing a solid prediction of apple quality based on the given features.
